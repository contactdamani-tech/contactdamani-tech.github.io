<h1>Industrial Applications</h1>

<p>
Damani Group position sensors are deployed in demanding industrial processes
where reliability and accuracy are critical.
</p>

<h2>Steel plants & continuous casting</h2>

<p>
Our sensors are used on continuous casting machines
to monitor the position of mechanical components,
segments and rolls exposed to extreme thermal and mechanical stresses.
</p>

<h2>Coke oven plants</h2>

<p>
In coke oven plants, our sensors operate in harsh environments
characterized by heat, dust and vibrations,
supporting reliable positioning and process control.
</p>

<h2>Machine builders & integrators</h2>

<p>
OEMs and system integrators integrate Damani Group sensors
into their machines to ensure precise positioning
and long-term operational stability.
