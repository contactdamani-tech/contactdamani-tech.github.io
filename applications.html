<h1>Applications in extreme industrial environments</h1>
<p>
DAMANI Group position sensors are deployed in demanding industrial processes
where reliability and accuracy are critical.
</p>

<h2>Sensors designed to operate where constraints are at their highest</h2>

<p>
Our sensors are used on continuous casting machines
to monitor the position of mechanical components,
segments and rolls exposed to extreme thermal and mechanical stresses.
</p>

<h2>Coke oven plants</h2>

<p>
In coke oven plants, our sensors operate in harsh environments
characterized by heat, dust and vibrations,
supporting reliable positioning and process control.
</p>

<h2>Machine builders & integrators</h2>

<p>
OEMs and system integrators integrate DAMANI Group sensors
into their machines to ensure precise positioning
and long-term operational stability.
</p>
<h3>Steel plants and steel mills</h3>
<p>
Positioning and monitoring of critical machines within steel production lines,
including areas exposed to extreme thermal and mechanical constraints.
</p>

<h3>Continuous casting</h3>
<p>
Measurement and positioning at the level of roller segments supporting the passage
of red-hot slabs, under extreme temperatures, heavy loads and continuous 24/7 operation.
</p>

<h3>Coke oven plants</h3>
<p>
Sensors adapted to high-temperature environments with dust and aggressive gases,
ensuring reliable positioning and operation of coke production equipment.
</p>

<h3>Heavy industry and special machinery</h3>
<p>
Integration on custom-built industrial machines, lifting equipment, presses,
conveyors and installations operating under severe conditions.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to a robust design and full control of its technology,
<strong>DAMANI Group</strong> supports industrial operators and machine builders
in improving reliability, safety and availability of their equipment.
